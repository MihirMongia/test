  <p>Hi! My name is Mihir Mongia and I'm almost finished with my PhD in the School of Computer Science at CMU. I currently work in the lab of Hosein Mohimani whose
	  overarching interest is to discover molecules naturally produced on this earth that humanity does not know exist and also have powerful use cases such as 
	  targeting cancer. I personally have worked on big data problems in this area. I have developed the fastest algorithm for searching and molecular networking 
	  of large datasets coming from tandem mass spectrometry. These algorithms are two to three orders of magnitude faster than what is currently available. 
	  I am also currently developing an algorithm that identifies a peptide corresponding to LC-MS spectrum. This algorithm is both fast and accurate. No algorithm currently can achieve both simultaneously.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  I will be starting a postdoc in the lab of Mike Snyder at Stanford in the fall of Stanford 2023. In the past I have spent a summer in the lab of Yoshua Bengio, where 
	  I learned about deep learning and wrote a short paper theoretically explaining texture generations methods common in the literature at the time.
